## Contribution guidelines

- Keep changes aligned with the implemented task types and documented behavior.
- Do not add secret values, personal endpoints, or account-specific configuration to the repository.
- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests.
- Update docs when behavior changes.
- Keep examples copy-pasteable and placeholder-based.
- Avoid overstating compatibility or production guarantees.

## Pull requests

A good pull request usually includes:

- a concise summary of the change
- why the change is needed
- tests or validation notes
- documentation updates if relevant

## Documentation style

This repository aims for documentation that is:

- clear
- practical
- implementation-aware
- safe for public distribution

If you add deployment examples, use placeholders instead of real secrets or private URLs.
